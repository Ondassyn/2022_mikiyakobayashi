    description: `Qurum is a cranial shape correction helmet that looks like a mesh knitted hat, designed in response to the strong desire of mothers to not feel as if their kids have a disease.It was developed under the supervision of doctors and specialists, in order to achieve a product completely efficient and safe with a design that blends into everyday life, making a clear distinction from conventional medical devices. An important aspect of the design process was to make it look more like a normal hat and this was achieved thanks to its slightly pronounced visor. Its mesh structure, which resembles knitwear, not only gives both strength and lightness, but also guarantees great breathability to enhance the comfort of the kids that will wear it. The helmet also features an internal cushion in special foam that can be easily detached and washed. Qurum is tailor-made in Japan with cutting-edge 3D print technology, shaped from precise data of the cranial deformation of each patient. As the helmet is split in two parts, the size can be adjusted according to the child's growth.`,

    description: `The Blood GA Analyser for Provigate marks an important step forward in the management of diabetic patients. GA (Glycoalbumin) is an alternative marker of glucose monitoring and may be more useful than HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin) in evaluating short-term glycemic changes. This device should be able to simplify the life of diabetic subjects and its design was achieved keeping in mind, during the whole process, three fundamental words: Honest, User-Friendly and Gentle. Except for the display and the back cover, the body doesn't have any flat surface, obtaining an overall soft feeling. Conceived for clinics and hospitals, thanks to the curved surfaces, the device looks even more compact than it is and its pure and honest appearance blends in every environment. The product is user-friendly for doctors and at the same time has a kind of familiar appearance which also puts patients at ease. The angled touch screen panel was carefully considered to be easily used both when sitting or standing. Its high gloss finishing creates a pleasant contrast with the matte body panels. In the front, a small door hides the slot for the samples testing cartridge, while in the back ports for power cable, usb, etc. found place. The ports are moved inward to let the device be placed as close as possible to a wall.`,

    description: `The name of Rena comes from the first sillabs of the words Refined Nature, since its design process went through several steps in order to achieve the essence of ergonomics, shape, functionality and aesthetics.
    Every detail of the backrest was carefully thought of, aiming at the best balance between structural strength and lightness, including the holes pattern and the rim, which not only improve the visual perception but also deliver exceptional comfort.
    Rena Chair, thanks to its pure essence and the multiple variations of finishes and colours inspired by nature, is ideal for any work space, either public or home, especially when paired with wooden furniture.
    The design considers the surrounding spaces the chair will be fitted in, as well as its users, since it adapts to the body for the best seating experience.
    Rena Chair is also kind to the environment, with textile options made using plant-derived raw materials.`,

    description: `Binkop was born from the desire of designing a drinking glass that could be manufactured like a jar, to achieve a well designed and robust product to be used for many years, yet easily recyclable when disposed of. It can be used as everyday glass either at home or in restaurants and cafes, as it is suitable to drink water or soft drinks, but also for spirits or hot drinks such as coffee, etc. As a result of a long design process, it combines aesthetics, ease of use and stackability, reflecting the Mingei philosophy of beauty in everyday objects, with a contemporary vision. Instead of hiding its manufacturing process, it enhances these details to achieve uniqueness and functionality, presenting an industrial yet soft appearance. The top part not only feels pleasant to the mouth while drinking, but it is also functional to be manufactured in the same way as a jar. It looks modern and classic at the same time, becoming the perfect new addition to the long life glass products lineup of Okawa Glass.`,

    description: `The Frame Clock for Hacoa presents an elegant and timeless design, with focus on high quality materials such as walnut wood and brass. The frame, which is made out of twelve parts, not only defines the hours indexes, but also expresses the difference in colour and grain of a natural material like walnut. The clock face, available in natural walnut, grey and white, is incastonated in the frame and enriched by the brass indexes. The hours and minutes hands are also made in brass and this will make the clock enjoyable over time as the brass parts will age during the years, adding value to the clock. Thanks to its clean design, the clock is easy to read, also because of the nice contrast between the brass and walnut, and its presence fits in any environment, either modern or classic and both in private or public spaces.`,

    description: `The project was born with the aim of designing a plate that could communicate better the pairing of different soy sauces with food and to promote the producers behind them, delivering a tasting experience. The main feature was to split the plate in three compartments so that different soy sauces could have been enjoyed in a single plate without getting mixed. The plate's clean presence is the result of a long development, where every detail has been perfected with the purpose of the function and optimisation of the production process. It is produced in the Hasami area, one of the most important in Japan for the production of ceramics. The size was carefully considered in order to contain the right amount of soy sauce but without interfering on the table with other tableware. The curvature of the containers allows one to enjoy the right amount of soy sauce, as a barely visible dent in the section minimises the excess of sauce. The "bridge" shape has the purpose to allow placing an explanation sheet underneath it, to suggest the best pairing with the food served, as well as information about the typology of sauces and producers. Stackability was another feature to keep in mind and every detail, from the tapered edges of the long sides to the slight curvature on the short ones, delivers a secure and tidy feeling when more plates are stored. The tapered edges also facilitate holding and moving the plate around, while working as structural elements. The plate, with its design resulting from an accurate development and without any unnecessary decoration, aims to become a standard in its category.`,
