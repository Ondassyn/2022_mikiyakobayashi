    description: `Frame Clock Mini is a wooden clock which combines a modern feel with a frame made of precious walnut. The result is a clean yet classic design, enhanced also by the brass second hand, which gives a precious touch to the whole.
The clock face is available in natural walnut, grey and white, with matching hands and index colours for excellent visibility in every version. Thanks to its compact size, it is usable both as a table clock or wall clock,
while its presence fits in any environment, either modern or classic. The simple square shape is enriched by the edges' details, which create depth and enlighten the overall perception.`,

    description: `Qurum is a cranial shape correction helmet that looks like a mesh knitted hat, designed in response to the strong desire of mothers to not feel as if their kids have a disease.It was developed under the supervision of doctors and specialists, in order to achieve a product completely efficient and safe with a design that blends into everyday life, making a clear distinction from conventional medical devices. An important aspect of the design process was to make it look more like a normal hat and this was achieved thanks to its slightly pronounced visor. Its mesh structure, which resembles knitwear, not only gives both strength and lightness, but also guarantees great breathability to enhance the comfort of the kids that will wear it. The helmet also features an internal cushion in special foam that can be easily detached and washed. Qurum is tailor-made in Japan with cutting-edge 3D print technology, shaped from precise data of the cranial deformation of each patient. As the helmet is split in two parts, the size can be adjusted according to the child's growth.`,

    description: `The Blood GA Analyser for Provigate marks an important step forward in the management of diabetic patients. GA (Glycoalbumin) is an alternative marker of glucose monitoring and may be more useful than HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin) in evaluating short-term glycemic changes. This device should be able to simplify the life of diabetic subjects and its design was achieved keeping in mind, during the whole process, three fundamental words: Honest, User-Friendly and Gentle. Except for the display and the back cover, the body doesn't have any flat surface, obtaining an overall soft feeling. Conceived for clinics and hospitals, thanks to the curved surfaces, the device looks even more compact than it is and its pure and honest appearance blends in every environment. The product is user-friendly for doctors and at the same time has a kind of familiar appearance which also puts patients at ease. The angled touch screen panel was carefully considered to be easily used both when sitting or standing. Its high gloss finishing creates a pleasant contrast with the matte body panels. In the front, a small door hides the slot for the samples testing cartridge, while in the back ports for power cable, usb, etc. found place. The ports are moved inward to let the device be placed as close as possible to a wall.`,
